A voice-cloning AI original designed by https://www.github.com/kyubyong/css10 modified by https://github.com/SeanPLeary/dc_tts-transfer-learning and also modified and used by our project: Life and death with Corona.

A story in which you can make political decisions as the Austrian Chancellor.
The AI ​​was used to synthetically reproduce a total of three voices:
Sebastian Kurz, 
Werner Kogler and 
Armin Wolf.


For the result, we had to edit and transcribe audio material for over an hour for each person. Training the AI ​​took about 3 days per person. The more audio material you have available, the better the results will be.


The website was implemented with laravel and Vue and can be found here: https://github.com/TheStefanK/Project-LaDwC
